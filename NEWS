CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.3
------------------------
    o You can select the Cloud Storage bucket region when you clone a 
    workspace by providing `bucketLocation` argument in the `cloneWorkspace` 
    function. The default is `us-central1` and the prior versions defaulted 
    to `multi-region`.
    o New function `getWorkflowConfig` is added and the output from this
    function is now required as an input for the `config` argument of 
    `currentInput`, `udpateInput`, and `runWorkflow` functions.
    This change makes the execution of different functions faster because they
    don't need to access AnVIL everytime to get the configuration.
    o New function `AnVILBrowse` is added
    o Stain normalization HE by PathML is also included as one of the available 
    analyses

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.0
------------------------
    o Initial release of the 'AnVILWorkflow' package
